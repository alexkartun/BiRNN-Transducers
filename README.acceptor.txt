How to run experiment.py file?

Type:
    python3 experiment.py train_file_path, dev_file_path

Should be 2 parameters to the script.
1) train_file_path - train's file path.
2) dev_file_path - dev's file path.

   F.E: python3 experiment.py examples_train examples_dev
   * examples_train, examples_dev: files located near the experiment.py script
